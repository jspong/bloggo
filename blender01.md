I started watching a [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QT1GNMevfc) on how to model a 3d character using [Blender3D](https://blender.org).

[![Blender Character Modeling #1](https://img.youtube.com/vi/0QT1GNMevfc/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QT1GNMevfc)

I must say, it is intimidating. To think that I could start from nothing, and learn how to make a real head and body seemed unfathomable from the outset. I’ve used photoshop, tried Maya -- I was a software pirate as a young child, with the privilege to acquire a computer to download + run warez, as well as the free time and foundational education to teach myself some basics. 
What I didn’t learn was a structured art background, and a growth mindset around my talents. So as somebody who can’t even picture a cartoon character in my own head, it’s scary to try to make a real representation of one. 

When the video started, I was surprised by how straightforward and grounded in reality it is. You don’t need to make a “mesh” and use fancy tools that I have to learn to conceptualize before I can use. He makes a square, tell the editor to be symmetrical, and extrude and join edges one at a time.

It was also exciting to see that he was making his faces flow in a way that mirrors real human anatomy, which makes sense: the faces should move as the muscles themselves move. 
I had recently listened to a podcast called “Animation is Hard”. Being self-abusive and always looking for an excuse as to why it was too complicated for me from the beginning, this seemed like the perfect place to start. The hosts griped about working with modelers who didn’t know how to make a model that would work with a rig. I didn’t know what it meant, but that sounded hard. Not knowing what it meant made it sound extra hard. I feel a little less intimidated now. Sure, there’s probably more to it than that, and I’m sure it takes a lot of practice to make it look halfway decent, let alone do it so quickly, but it’s also probably made up of similarly small-yet-significant, intuitive steps. Other people learn how to do it. Yes, they are talented in ways that I am not, and they have been making art for a long time, but the teaching structure exists. The craft has been broken down into smaller parts, and I am capable of consuming and integrating them. I may not be a professional 3d artist, but that’s not what I want to be, and I can have fun with it if I take the pressure off of myself.

I need to take some time to learn the hotkeys, and where the options are -- and with Blender 2.8 it’s all going to be different. It’s cool how you can split the editor into front- and side-views and overlay reference images. If you grasp that workflow, you can model pretty much anything.

I also feel intimidated by the voice in my head that says “don’t make derivative work.” There’s nothing revolutionary or ground-breaking about making a 3d humanoid cartoon character model. I will also likely make an inferior version to start, and that's scary. If I don't try, I can't embarass myself. But if I don't try, I won't learn. That's how the process goes. So I'm going to lean into that. I'm going to make a model and be proud of my efforts, no matter how shitty it turns out. I bet I'll be pleasantly surprised with how it turns out, in fact.

To further lean into the vulnerability of it all, I'm going to record the process. It's going to be slow-going, so I'll do a time lapse. I'll record myself, too. I downloaded the [Iris Screen Recorder](https://staticz.com/iris/) to make a screen-cap with talking head. I'm trying to use free tools right now -- hopefully it's not just because I'm cheap, but because I value free access to tools and information. I may end up buying some other tools - I like to help support developers who are making cool stuff.

So I'll capture timelapse video of my efforts so that I can see how it comes together. I'll capture timelapse videos of my process so that I can show it to others. I have a lot of privilege: I'm a tall white male with an established career (although more on that later, I hope to more intentionally shape my career, and I hope that putting myself out there in this way helps me put myself out there at work too). I was raised by college professors, and spent a lot of time growing up in university computer labs. Like I said, I downloaded Photoshop and Maya when I was in high school; I have experience with these tools so I have a leg-up and am not starting from zero. Other people without all that need to know that even I struggle. I need to know that it's ok to struggle. We all need to share our struggles because crafts are honed over time. Nobody is born knowing how to do things, and we all spend way too much time trying to hide the effort behind the work... or at least I do.
