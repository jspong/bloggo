There are a lot of moments when I'm creating or existing, and not just thinking. There are more moments where I'm blocked by thinking though. I preempt a lot of my ideas because I feel like they're dumb, or I need permission from some imagined authority - be it an individual, academic lore, or some arbitrary process - and I never go far enough to even try them out. 

The only way past my mental blocks is through them. Regardless of whatever fears come up, I can experience them, remind myself that they are not real or productive, and create anyways.

There are many ways that one can use goals to push themselves past their comfort zones.

- [Inktober](https://inktober.com), and similar challenges, try to build daily habits by forcing you to perform a task every day for a month.
- [Game Jams](https://www.google.com/search?q=game+jam&oq=game+jam&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.1335j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) can force you to create by putting a time limit on how long you can spin your wheels before you must produce a creation.

Because of my issues with authority, I want to encourage myself to work when I want to work, and how I want to work. Working for 30 days, or making one thing over the course of a weekend doesn't seem like a good way to encourage sustainable, healthy creative process afterwards.

I do, however, like the structure of these events, and I like how they often provide specific themes or constraints. 

Several years ago, I picked up this thematically organized encyclopedia of symbols in a bookstore on a whim:

[![Book of Symbols](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51e01kqxaKL.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/Book-Symbols-Reflections-Archetypal-Images/dp/3836514486)

When I was thinking of ways to work with this book, the need for an authority began creeping in: I had trouble finding ways to choose a symbol that didn't come from an external source:

1. I could pick a random symbol. I wanted to use a [PRNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_generator) to pick a page number so I wouldn't "fall into the habit" of picking symbols "in my comfort zone" (a phrase my wife helpfully illuminated as me not allowing myself to have preferences). 
2. I could work my way through the book in order. This also seems to defer preference to keep from choosing myself.

Because of this, I will instead go through and find a symbol that interests me. In the future, I can work through other peoples' systems and challenges and whatnot, but I need to learn to allow myself to want, to choose, to feel, and to like, before I can freely let myself bleed.
