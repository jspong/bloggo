I made my first head in Blender3d!

I watched some great [Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLa1F2ddGya_8V90Kd5eC5PeBjySbXWGK1) that the [Blender Foundation](https://www.blender.org) put out for total 3d beginners. I'm a nerd with some very minor experience playing around with a pirated copy of Maya in high school (sorry), one 3d graphics course in college (mostly lighting models and non-programmable pipelines), and some recent Unity exploration, but I really need a dive into the fundamentals, and it has already proven quite useful.

First, I know how to navigate the interface, and several keyboard shortcuts to work with. It doesn't matter what I know, I still need somebody to tell me which button does what.

That tripped me up at times, too. I got confused with how frequently the right mouse button is used in Blender. Combined with real functionality in the scroll wheel, it does feel like it will be three times as efficient when I get used to it, so I'm willing to put in the effort. I'm also having a lot of trouble remembering keyboard shortcuts as they seem to (as always) be based on a combination of intuitive mnemonics, derived from jargon, and based on convenience or availability.

But damn was it fun. I was definitely scared to get started, especially given my [previous attempt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixOWlxha1fg). I remembered to start above the mouth and extrude a circle of faces around it, but I couldn't remember much about how the tutorial says to build up the mesh in the front. So I played around and just tried to make progress, rather than get blocked by not knowing the "right" way; I figured my mistakes would make themselves apparent, and that certainly turned out to be the case.

Other than learning the interface and jumping in with both feet, I can't say that I did much right in this, but I'm learning that that's just about the most important thing you can do if you want to develop a new skill. There's holes in the face; gaps between the edges. I forgot to make the nose in front of the rest of the face. I didn't realize until after that I could have positioned the reference images in front of the model. I intersected faces with their own mirror images, and I have no idea if they were connected or how to make them be connected. It doesn't match on top, and it's far too narrow. 

It's imperfect and so much better than the last time I tried, and so much worse than the next one will be, and I love it and am so proud of it.
