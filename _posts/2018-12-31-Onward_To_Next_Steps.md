I worked through the [first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QT1GNMevfc&t=599s) [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VswCmVMLiEE&t=7s) videos of a basic character modeling tutorial in blender, and it got me from making a [lumpy patch of squares](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixOWlxha1fg) to a [nearly respectable rendition of a head-shaped object](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UGMWChCSzc&t=1s).

It helped build my self esteem regarding learning new things, but I definitely need to learn more fundamentals before moving on. It's tempting to say that I made an improvement, be too scared to try to refine it, and quit, but I will continue to move forward on my game development and 3d art trajectory. I'm building skills, and I hope creative inspiration follows (I have aphantasia, as well as some psychological issues, and a lack of internally-driven "things to make" tends to be why I stop developing skills after I reach a certain intermediate point).

Because the art and the programming are mutually-benefical skills, I like to go back and forth between them, especially since if I'm far more advanced in one, the lack of experience with the other can be just enough hindrance I need to give myself an excuse to quit.

So since I just did work with Blender, I'm going to go back to work on Unity. I played around with it a bit yesterday, but didn't do any screencaps, nor did I create anything of note. I'm a bit disappointed, however, since I've wanted to document and share that exploratory phase, but I copped out and did it off-camera.

Because the [fundamental Blender tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLa1F2ddGya_8V90Kd5eC5PeBjySbXWGK1) were so beneficial for me, I'm going to do the same in Unity, and watch their [Basic Tutorials](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials). There's a lot to do, so I just watched a neat [Hovercar Live-Training Video](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules/beginner/live-training-archive/hover-car-physics?playlist=17120), which was cool because I could double the speed and still get what I needed from it. It also usefully demonstrated quickly prototyping the scene with cubes, using standard assets from the store, and renaming in-game objects so you can find them, all of which are habits that I hope to develop. I'm looking forward to watching tutorials on [Graphics](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/graphics), [Physics](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/physics), [Navigation/AI](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/navigation), and I'm always fond of [Best Practices](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/best-practices).

After that, I hope to make and share some sort of game project, and get back to Blender modelling.

There's a [Blender Guru Modeling Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi87Dap_WOc) I want to work through, and WikiBooks has a [Blender: Noob to Pro](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro) book that looks pretty cool.
