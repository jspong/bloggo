### Unity

I downloaded and started a [Unity tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPiCgCkHTE). It's a super basic 2D-platformer intro. There's no coding whatsoever so far; just drag+drop assets and configure predefined physics. It's impressive that things are so intuitively configurable (although I would MUCH rather have two monitors and a mouse than work on a MBP), and yet you can put anything in it. It's cool to have the interactive scene editor to tie it all together, whereas I'm also excited to see the internals of code, and the modular parts to make complex games from.

I'm really excited. I'm a little high, but my heart is racing. I can't help but smile. It's humbling to see something so simple come together. It's a master work. It reminds me of using Maya back when I used to pirate software for fun (sorry AutoDesk, please don't sue).

I was too scared to learn how to use Maya well, and I don't want that to happen again this time. It feels great to create, even if it's as simple as a robot jumping onto platforms. It's super fun. I know a real game will take much more, and I'm pretty excited about that, actually.

The tutorial begins by adding some assets to the scene and then putting a ground sprite under that. The tutorial was somewhat out-of-date so I made a few platforms of my own. It's so cool how you just add a collision box to a sprite and voila! I can't wait to dig in and see all the different internal abstractions. 

The character asset had a built-in input controller and movement/jumping configuration, so it got walking around right away. I thought that was cool. Then, we made the camera a child of the character asset so it followed it when it moved. I thought THAT was cool! THEN he was like "nah, that looks like shit; check this out." We added a camera control script that had lookahead, smoothing, and returned to the character when it steadied. That shit was cool.

I also purused the Asset Store very briefly. It's full of everything I may want, free or paid, and some of the stuff on their is pretty neat. Definitely makes me smile.

Again: I am excited about this. I'm also really happy Xoxi pressured me into journaling about this, it's pretty great, and I know it's going to be great to look back on to see how far I've come. Both in the game development, and in the journalling :D GOTTA START SOMETIME, MOTHERFUCKERS.
