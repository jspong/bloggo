## A Spark of Inspiration

I have been programming computers for a long time, but I haven't really done a *fun* project that made sense to me. I've long been interested in retro games, and the incredible games that people made pushing simple machines like the NES to their limits has fascinated me for quite some time. I played a lot of a few, specific games in high school, like Quake 3, Final Fantasy X. I recently bought a PS4 and have been enjoying Persona V a lot. Kingdom Hearts sucked, although I didn't play it for long. I love LucasArts adventure games, and have played through Monkey Islands 1, 2, 3, and 4 countless times.

I want to make a game.

I want to have fun coding. I want a simple environment that lets me iterate quickly, and to get something bootstrapped fast. I also want to create a product that I wish existed, using my programming skills as a means to an end rather than the end itself. 

There are a lot of levels that I can work at. I can get a simple graphics + audio library with a control loop and code something in python. I can build something using Unity in C#, which would be cool, and give me a high-level overview of the pieces of a game engine from a designer's perspective. I also have been reading through a 6502 Assembly tutorial, and would also like to build an NES game from scratch. There are a lot of options, and the only thing to do is to start.

Unfortunately, my technical abilities vastly outweigh my creative discipline. I have aphantasia, and a long history of being OK with just about whatever. I've made some paintings that I am very proud of, but they are very abstract, and they just sort of happened during a period of significant awakening in my life.

### Games I Like

#### Console Games

* Final Fantasy Series
* Mario 3
* Guardian Legend
* Zelda Series
* Persona V

#### Computer Games

* LucasArts
 * Monkey Island series
 * Grim Fandango
 * Day of the Tentacle
 * Sam and Max, and Full Throttle were too hard / unintuitive, so I never got into them
* STAR CONTROL II

* First Person Shooters (good fun at LAN parties)
 * Quake 3
 * Unreal Tournament


It's funny; as I try to make this list, I remember tons of other games that I used to play. I spent hours and hours alone with my computer playing games. If I try to think about what I liked most about the ones that I really liked, two main things come to mind: fast, simple, casual action; and humor. I mostly knew what to do ahead of time. The hardest, most in-depth games that I played, my older brother Matt always played first: Final Fantasy, Zelda, Star Control II; all nonlinear games of free exploration, all games that I watched Matt play and then repeated his movements. I beat the Guardian Legend while listening to copious amounts of Goldfinger in High School, but used save states because I don't like games to be too hard. I'm playing Persona V on easy, and that's the way I like it. 

### Where I Am Now

Standing at the beginning of path that I'm scared to begin walking down.

This morning, I was perseverating on a NES game. Glimpses of images faintly appearing into a mind previously unable to form pictures. There are so many mechanics in NES games, I'm not sure which I want to build. I may try to do a lot of them; each would  come with its own technical challenge. Trying to fit the code for  multiple into the size of a single ROM would be its own unique problem. If I see similarities in the code, I may find crossovers between mechanics.

Then I looked out the window. We live in a large housing development with a lot of interesting characters. I saw the old woman who unofficially runs our local dog park on the sidewalk. She's quite strange, and quite delightful. When I saw her, a template for a character emerged in my mind. My mind flashed for a moment as I realized what to many was likely already an obvious truism: creative people draw inspiration from the lives that they live. The characters they create are the characters they already know. It feels silly but is indescribably significant. A simple knowledge that has lived tangential to my conscious understanding, yet completely inactionable until that very moment.

An old woman, walking off-kilter. Long, shoulder-length grey and black hair perched atop her head. An ill-fitting t-shirt with some unintentionally hilarious slogan regarding how the wearer sure does like to party written on it. I dunno, does she wear a long skirt? What kind of shoes? I don't always notice these details, because often-times inspecting peoples' appearance loses the battle for limited attention to the myriad of fears and patterns swirling around my mind at any given time.

KK and I made up Pok√©mon on the way home. I thought it would be fun to make a game featuring a squirrel. They're cute and funny looking.

I think the art would be fun, and yet I have trouble imagining, and have not put in the effort to be much of a drawer. I have told myself it's because I'm colorblind (I'm only partly red-green colorblind. I wish I knew what the real term for that was), and therefore was incapable of pairing colors. I very consciously and actively rejected dressing myself in nice clothes, although it's only been recently that I've begun to address the real underlying reasons behind that. Like all 30-something millenials, I blame my parents. Obviously.

The art would be fun, though. 8-bit pixel art is cool, and iconic, but very limiting. I was looking at animation software today, and think I might give [Synfig](http://www.synfig.org) a whirl. I'd like to try [Moho](https://my.smithmicro.com/anime-studio-pro-debut-compare-versions.html) but it's like $400, and throwing money at tools won't get me working. I bet it exports into a format that Unity can import and animate, which is a big reason to try a mature engine. 

I want to look into options for NES development. I know there are some sprite editors, I saw some info for a C-environment, some dude made a LUA framework for "unit testing". I may want to look into building an end-to-end edit, build, test, and deploy workflow that I'm proud of and can be productive with if one doesn't exist already.

It's also important that I just have some damn fun. I want to get things pushed to GitHub. I want to write some blog posts. I want to make games, and apps. I want to learn Haskell and Prolog.

I want my work to make me happy again.

What I need to do first: get Unity going (if it's not already). Do a platformer tutorial. Build! Build! Build!

Build! Build Something! Build Anything! Action breeds results. Action leads to more action. Build Something!!!
